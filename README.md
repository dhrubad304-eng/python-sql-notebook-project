# Data Analysis Notebook Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow.  
It includes data exploration, transformations, SQL logic, and step-by-step execution for clarity and learning.

## Project Highlights
- Structured analysis inside a Jupyter Notebook
- Step-by-step breakdown of logic and results
- Clean and organized workflow for understanding and reuse
- Combines SQL-style operations and Python-based analysis
- Beginner-friendly structure suitable for portfolio demonstration

## Notebook Included
- `notebook.ipynb`  
  Contains the entire analysis including code cells, outputs, explanations, and workflow steps.

## Tech Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- SQL-style logic
- Data analysis libraries (pandas, numpy, etc., if applicable)

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the cells in order to reproduce the full analysis.
4. Modify or extend the logic as needed for further experimentation.

## Use Case
